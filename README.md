# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples from
"Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen".

It additionally contains the solution to the optimization exercises 
by making more computations in a matrix like fashion to take advantage
of the efficient linear algebra execution.
